            <h1>Evolve or Extinct</h1>

            <p>
                In designing Evolve or Extinct, the central goal was to teach evolutionary biology, focusing on
                adaptation, natural selection and environmental pressures. These are foundational concepts in life
                sciences that are often difficult to visualize or explain to young learners. To communicate these ideas
                effectively, we used simple, intuitive game mechanics where each player becomes an animal trying to
                survive in the wild.
            </p>
            <p>Animal Cards represent real species, encouraging players to connect with biodiversity. Trait Cards
                symbolize inherited traits (like “Camouflage” or “Fast Legs”) that help an animal survive environmental
                dangers. Danger Cards simulate ecological challenges (such as droughts, predators, and ice storms),
                showing how survival is tied to having the right traits at the right time. By surviving dangers or
                collecting useful traits, players experience a simplified version of how species evolve to meet
                environmental demands.
            </p>

            <h2>Simplification and Representation</h2>
            <p>



                We simplified complex ideas like gene expression, reproductive success, and population dynamics into
                cause effect relationships that are easy to grasp. For example:

                Having Camouflage protects you from a Predator Attack. Not having a useful trait means losing a “life”
                (representing death or extinction risk).

                This clear linkage helps players internalize how specific traits provide survival advantages. We avoided
                technical terms and focused on intuitive understanding. Instead of explaining natural selection in a
                textbook way, we allow players to feel the impact of selection through gameplay. Tokens represent
                limited resources, encouraging strategic decision making, just like organisms must make trade offs in
                nature.

                Confusion about which traits matched which dangers:
                Some players had difficulty remembering what each trait did.

                Players who received less helpful traits early felt at a disadvantage.
                <!-- Response: We introduced a token economy , allowing players to buy Trait Cards using tokens. This added

                Some players were eliminated quickly, which made the game less fun.
                <!-- Response: We added an alternate win condition collecting five traits so players could focus on
                “evolving” even if they faced early danger. -->

    <div id="conclusion">
        <p>In conclusion, Evolve or Extinct! simplifies evolution into an engaging experience that’s accessible to
            young learners. Through choices, survival, and consequences, the game builds a foundational
            understanding of how traits affect an organism’s survival. By blending storytelling, decision making,
            and science, the game becomes a powerful tool for science communication, encouraging both learning and
            curiosity about the natural world.<br>
